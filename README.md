A simple Python script that automatically fetches the latest top headlines from the BBC News homepage. It uses the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to parse the site's HTML and saves the headlines to a .txt file.

This project demonstrates basic web scraping concepts, including making HTTP requests, parsing HTML, and saving data to a file.

Features
Fetches real-time headlines from BBC News.

Uses a User-Agent header to mimic a real browser.

Saves the extracted headlines to a timestamped headlines.txt file.

Handles potential errors during the scraping process gracefully.

Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language.

Requests: For making HTTP requests to fetch the website's content.

BeautifulSoup4: For parsing the HTML and extracting the desired data.

Setup and Usage
Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

1. Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system.

2. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
cd your-repository-name

3. Create a Virtual Environment
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

Windows:

python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

macOS / Linux:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

4. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages using the requirements.txt file:

pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Run the Scraper
Execute the Python script to start scraping:

python news_scraper.py

6. View the Output
After the script finishes, a file named headlines.txt will be created in the project directory with the latest news headlines.

How It Works
Fetch HTML: The script sends a GET request to https://www.bbc.com/news with a User-Agent header to identify itself as a standard web browser.

Parse HTML: The raw HTML response is parsed into a structured BeautifulSoup object, which makes it easy to navigate and search.

Extract Headlines: The script searches for all <h2> and <h3> tags, which are commonly used for headlines on the BBC News site.

Save to File: The extracted headline text is cleaned up and written into the headlines.txt file, ready for viewing.

This is a simple educational project. Please be mindful of website's terms of service when scraping.
